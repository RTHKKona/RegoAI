# RegoAI

> This project is the development of an AI that can play the Blokus board game through algorithms and machine learning.
> Through appropriate sorting algorithms and pruning of weaker moves, RegoAI aims to have multiple variables that determine aggression, maximization of perceived area and the blocking of enemy piece vertices.
> Similar to Stockfish, an evaluation bar will be able to determine the approximate game state for each player.
